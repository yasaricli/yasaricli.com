        <p>
          For about <b>{ALL_YEARS} years</b> I have been involved in coding,
          development. During these <b>{ALL_YEARS} years</b> I have worked both
          as a <b>frontend</b> and <b>backend</b> developer. Thru the years I
          have been worked on many projects involving a variety of coding
          languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last <b>{JS_YEARS} years</b> I have shifted most of my
          attention to <b>javascript</b>, especially
          <a href="//www.meteor.com" target="_blank">
            Meteor Framework
          </a>
          . This allowed me to progress fairly quickly in my aptitude with <b>javascript</b>. Generally I am more interested structure
          development. Most of my time is spend working on <a href="//github.com/yasaricli" target="_blank">Github</a> open source projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also I like to and do support <b>open source</b> projects.
        </p>
		<p>I am currently working as a Frontend Team Leader in <a href="//www.tatilsepeti.com" target="_blank">Tatilsepeti</a> company and I am a founder of <a href="https://www.frontekip.com" target="_blank">Frontekip</a>.</p>
